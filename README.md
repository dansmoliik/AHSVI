# main.java.java.AHSVI
Adversarial Heuristic Search Value Iteration 

## Description
main.java.java.AHSVI algorithm consists of two agents called a defender and an attacker.
The defender chooses a defense measures (honeypots, thresholds, etc.) which influences the attacker's initial belief about the possible POMDP states.
The attacker then performs sequential attacks that we compute using main.java.java.AHSVI algorithm described in [1].
The A-main.java.java.AHSVI algorithm was initially described in [2].
